# Team Fortress Jumper
A small demo built in Godot 4.1 that attempts to recreate how it feels to rocket-jump around in **Team Fortress 2**.
As it stands, it's pretty close. Collisions are almost entirely broken. Things like bunny-hopping may also be intentionally turned on (they're pretty fun to mess around with).

<sup> Do not judge this code quality. </sup>

This repository has not been originally designed to be visible by the public, but I'm putting it out there. It could be useful as a general point of reference. 
Full support for this demo, as well as additional features _(such as multiplayer)_ should **not** be taken for granted.

You can try a **considerably** stripped out version of this project on a Chromium web browser by [clicking here](https://mickeon.netlify.app/team-fortress-jumper/).

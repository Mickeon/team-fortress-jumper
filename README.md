# Team Fortress Jumper
A small demo built in Godot that attempts to recreate how it feels to rocket-jump around in Team Fortress 2.
As it stands, it's pretty close. Collisions are almost entirely broken. Things like bunny-hopping is also intentionally allowed (it's pretty fun to mess around with).

This repository has not been originally designed to be visible by the public, but I'm putting it out there. It could be useful as a general point of reference.
Full support for this demo, as well as additional features (such as multiplayer) should **not** be taken for granted.
